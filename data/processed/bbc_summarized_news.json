At 01:00 on Tuesday morning Carwin Javier Molleja was dancing with his mother in Santo Domingo's Jet Set nightclub when he noticed something fall from the ceiling. 'What I have in my head are the screams, the loud sound of the ceiling falling in, my mum's screams asking me if I'm OK, me asking her if she's OK,' Carwin recalls. Both Carwin and his mother, who had been standing near the stage, were struck on the head by pieces of falling ceiling, but were lucky to avoid serious injury. He says he wanted to continue trying to find his friend, but needed to take home his mother, who was in pain.",

Pete Belton, 44, from Ilkeston says he was shocked to find his forearm featured in a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) document used to help identify alleged members of Tren de Aragua (TdA), a transnational criminal organisation. One of them led BBC Verify to an Instagram post by a Nottingham-based tattoo artist who posted about Mr Belton's tattoo nearly a decade ago. Mr Belton's tattoo - a clock face with the date and time of his daughter's birth - was included in a set of nine images for 'detecting and identifying' TdA members. The same image of Mr Belton's tattoo also appeared in a September 2024 reportby the Texas Department of Public Safety(DPS) about TdA activity.",

But by Wednesday evening, officials said that given the conditions at the site observed by the more than 300 rescue workers, they would conclude the rescue phase of their operations 'within hours'. The owner of the Jet Set nightclub, Antonio Espaillat, delivered a video message via social media expressing his condolences and those of 'all the Jet Set family', to the victims' relatives. Hours later, the government released a statement saying that 'all reasonable chances of finding more survivors have been exhausted' and so the search and rescue mission would give way to the recovery of bodies. Behind her as she spoke to me on Wednesday afternoon, a team of rescue workers was meticulously going through the rubble inside the building, listening for the slightest sound of a survivor beneath them.",

        "summary_extractive": "Gangs use three main methods to smuggle cocaine into shipments: hiding drugs in cargo before it reaches the port, breaking into containers at the port, or attaching drugs to ships at sea. The Albanian mafia has expanded its presence in Ecuador in recent years, drawn by key trafficking routes through the country, and it now controls much of the cocaine flow from South America to Europe. After cocaine arrives in Ecuador from Colombia or Peru it is stashed in warehouses until his Albanian employers become aware of a shipping container that will be leaving one of the ports for Europe. Police say they seized a record amount of illicit drugs last year, the majority of it cocaine, and that this indicates total exports are on the rise. Despite Ecuador not producing the drug, 70% of the world's cocaine now flows through its ports, Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa says.",
