        "date": "2025-04-11T08:22:10.539Z",
        "content": "At 01:00 on Tuesday morning Carwin Javier Molleja was dancing with his mother in Santo Domingo's Jet Set nightclub when he noticed something fall from the ceiling. At the time, he didn't think much of it. \"No-one thought that because a small stone fell the entire roof was going to collapse,\" he says. The percussionist, who had moved to the Dominican Republic eight years earlier, was out with his mother, Carmen, and friends to see a concert by merengue singer Rubby Pérez. It was the first time Carwin, 32, and his mother had seen each other in three years and it was meant to be a night of joy and celebration. But in the early hours of Tuesday morning, disaster struck. \"What I have in my head are the screams, the loud sound of the ceiling falling in, my mum's screams asking me if I'm OK, me asking her if she's OK,\" Carwin recalls. \"Everything happened so fast. I guess I closed my eyes and my instinct was to hug my mum.\" Both Carwin and his mother, who had been standing near the stage, were struck on the head by pieces of falling ceiling, but were lucky to avoid serious injury. Rubby Perez was among those killed. In the chaos that quickly unfolded, Carwin managed to find a door through which he and his mother escaped outside. But his friend Jessica and her sister were still in the club. Desperate to find them, he decided to go back inside. Inside the club, Carwin desperately shouted Jessica's name but no one answered. He says he felt powerless to help those who had become trapped under the debris. \"The stones were huge. I felt useless.\" Carwin says he then repeatedly went out of the building, where he'd try to call paramedics, then return inside to shout his friend's name and call her phone. \"After that, the calls stopped going through.\" Carwin describes the aftermath of the collapse as \"total chaos\". \"People were going crazy,\" he says. \"They were pulling out injured people. I saw when they pulled out the saxophonist who died.\" Within minutes of the collapse, emergency services arrived, as ambulances and stretchers \"kept coming\". Carwin says he remained at the scene for about an hour and a half after the collapse. In that time, he says he didn't see any machinery arriving to remove the debris. He says he wanted to continue trying to find his friend, but needed to take home his mother, who was in pain. \"I needed to get her home and calm her down.\" Later that day, Jessica and her sister's lifeless bodies were found among the rubble. At least 221 people were killed in the disaster. Carwin says he regrets not having been able to do more for his friend. \"It was horrible not being able to help her. I yelled her name, but she didn't answer. It feels awful not being able to do anything.\" With reporting by Isabel Caro and Alicia Hernández."

        "date": "2025-04-11T01:10:39.584Z",
        "content": "A general strike against public spending cuts in Argentina has severely disrupted transport. All domestic flights have been cancelled, while trains and metro services have been suspended in Buenos Aires and other parts of the country. Many shops remained closed in the capital but bus drivers continued to work. Airlines said international flights would go ahead as planned, with only a few delays. It is the third general strike called by Argentina's powerful unions since President Javier Milei took office at the end of 2023. Since then, the president has introduced tough austerity measures to tackle hyperinflation. His plan has worked so far, with inflation down from more than 200% to about 60% a year. But the unions say the most vulnerable in society have been affected, including pensioners and low-paid workers. Milei has slashed subsidies for transport, fuel and energy, fired tens of thousands of public servants and closed government departments. Horacio Bianchi, a retired teacher living in Buenos Aires, told the Associated Press news agency people were suffering as they \"don't have enough money to eat\". \"These people [the government] came to solve the problems and they have absolutely worsened them for everyone,\" he added. On Wednesday, workers had joined a weekly protest staged by pensioners who have seen their pension funds slashed.  In recent weeks, their protests have ended in violence as sympathetic groups, such as football fans, clashed with police. The protest action comes as the Argentine government awaits whether it will be granted a new $20bn (£15.4bn) loan from the International Monetary Fund. The country already owes the lender $44bn. The US Treasurysaid Milei had \"brought Argentina back from economic oblivion\". US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will travel to Buenos Aires on Monday in support of the reforms."

        "title": "British man's tattoo wrongly linked to Venezuelan gang in US government document",
        "date": "2025-04-10T23:08:08.769Z",
        "content": "A tattoo belonging to a man from Derbyshire has appeared in a US government document used to identify members of a notorious Venezuelan gang - despite the man having no connection to the group. Pete Belton, 44, from Ilkeston says he was shocked to find his forearm featured in a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) document used to help identify alleged members of Tren de Aragua (TdA), a transnational criminal organisation. \"I'm just an average middle-aged man from Derbyshire,\" he told BBC Verify. Mr Belton said it was a \"bit strange, bit funny at first\" but is now worried the family trip he booked to Miami with his wife and daughter in August might end up \"being a six month all-inclusive holiday to Guantanamo\". The Trump administration has already deported hundreds of alleged gang members toa high-security jail in El Salvador. Lawyers for some of those deportees say they have been incorrectly identified as TdA members based on their tattoos. Mr Belton's tattoo - a clock face with the date and time of his daughter's birth - was included in a set of nine images for \"detecting and identifying\" TdA members. Other tattoos featured stars, crowns and a Michael Jordan \"jumpman\" logo. \"Open source material has depicted TdA members with a combination of the below tattoos,\" statesthe document which appeared in court filings. But reverse image searches show that several of the pictures first appeared on tattoo websites with no obvious links to Venezuela or TdA. One of them led BBC Verify to an Instagram post by a Nottingham-based tattoo artist who posted about Mr Belton's tattoo nearly a decade ago. The tattoo image in the DHS document is worse quality than the Instagram post, which was shared in 2016, but it is clearly the same arm and features the same clock face tattoo. The same image of Mr Belton's tattoo also appeared in a September 2024 reportby the Texas Department of Public Safety(DPS) about TdA activity. BBC Verify contacted both the US DHS and the Texas DPS about the source of the images, but did not receive a response. But in an email the DHS said it was confident in its law enforcement's intelligence and that its \"assessments go well beyond just gang affiliate tattoos and social media.\" It's unclear exactly how Mr Belton's tattoo ended up in the US documents, but he's worried about being linked to the gang. \"In my head I'm thinking if I'm working in border force and I saw me walking through I'd think 'hey up we've got one, he's the one in the document'.\" He provided multiple images of the tattoo to prove that it's his - and he says that he has no association to the Venezuelan group. The US government hasn't deported anyone based on their tattoos alone, according to comments from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)official in a court filing last month. However, court documents show immigration officials are employing a points-based system known as the\"Alien Enemy Validation Guide\"to determine if someone is linked to the Venezuelan gang. It includes a scorecard, and according to the document, eight points across a number of categories could be grounds for arrest or deportation. Half of these points can be given if a \"subject has tattoos denoting membership or loyalty to TdA\". The document says if all eight points come from the symbolism category, which includes tattoos, then further consultation should be taken before designating someone as a member of TdA. Venezuelan investigative journalist Ronna Risquez, who wrote a book on TdA's origins, said tattoos alone are not evidence of membership. \"TdA does not have tattoos that identifies the gang,\" she said. \"To confirm whether a person is a member of TdA, authorities must conduct a police investigation to determine whether they have a criminal record. A tattoo, their clothing, or their nationality are not proof.\" However, there have been cases where lawyers have argued that people have been wrongfully identified based on their tattoos and were subsequently deported. US mediahave reported on a man whose lawyers say was deported because of a crown tattoo which was inspired by the Real Madrid football club logo. Another case saw a makeup artistsent to El Salvador after his a crown tattoo with the words \"mum\" and \"dad\" was used by US officials as evidence for gang membership, according to his attorneys. Back in Derbyshire, Mr Belton says his family have considered cancelling their trip to the US due to the potential risks, but they are going to monitor how the story develops. \"Hopefully now they'd realise I'm not a Venezuelan gangster but I've seen crazier things happen in the news recently, so we're just going to wait and see.\" What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"

        "date": "2025-04-10T09:52:48.582Z",
        "content": "Máximo Peña had been coming to the Jet Set nightclub every single Monday for the past 30 years. This week, excited to see a concert by the popular Dominican singer Rubby Pérez, he took his wife and his sister. Now all three are buried beneath the rubble of the collapsed discotheque, after the roof caved in part way through the performance, leaving at least 218 dead. \"I haven't heard any news about any of them,\" said Shailyn Peña, Máximo's 17-year-old daughter as she sat on a wall outside the devastated venue. \"It was just another Monday night for them. In fact, my dad invited my mum to come too but at the last minute she decided not to go. It was a blessing in disguise.\" Behind her as she spoke to me on Wednesday afternoon, a team of rescue workers was meticulously going through the rubble inside the building, listening for the slightest sound of a survivor beneath them. They had been joined by Israeli and Mexican search teams and were using sophisticated heat-seeking equipment to try to locate anyone still alive. Shailyn told me her cousin was one of the rescue workers, sifting through the debris for her own uncle, which she said brought her peace of mind that a relative was inside doing everything in her power to try to track Máximo down. But the uncertainty and the endless wait for information were becoming unbearable, Shailyn said. \"I feel the urge to just go in there and push aside all the rocks and pull him out. But as much as I want to, I really can't. I just have to sit here and wait it out.\" Hours later, the government released a statement saying that \"all reasonable chances of finding more survivors have been exhausted\" and so the search and rescue mission would give way to the recovery of bodies. The authorities have been doing what they can to keep the public informed, delivering grim updates on the number of dead, which has risen steadily with every passing hour. At regular intervals, teams have been emerging from the site carrying bodies covered by blankets on stretchers. Earlier on, some people were brought out alive, bolstering the hopes of the relatives. The head of the Emergency Operations Center (COE) said that since the roof collapse, 189 people had been \"rescued alive\". But by Wednesday evening, officials said that given the conditions at the site observed by the more than 300 rescue workers, they would conclude the rescue phase of their operations \"within hours\". The president of the Dominican Republic, Luis Abinader, has declared three days of national mourning, a reflection of the scale of the tragedy unfolding at the site. Among those confirmed to have lost their lives in the accident were some well-known national figures including Pérez himself, two much-loved former baseball players, Octavio Dotel and Tony Blanco, and a regional governor. And alongside them, scores of merengue music-lovers and Pérez fans also died in the collapse. For now, the authorities' focus remains on the recovery operation. However, eventually the questions will turn to the cause of the collapse and government investigators will have to provide meaningful answers to the families in due course. One theory is already circulating outside the venue. Many are pointing the finger of blame at a fire at the nightclub around two years ago. Some fear the blaze structurally weakened the site or that any repairs carried out were insufficient or not up to code. The owner of the Jet Set nightclub, Antonio Espaillat, delivered a video message via social media expressing his condolences and those of \"all the Jet Set family\", to the victims' relatives. He also insisted that he and his team were co-operating \"totally and transparently with the authorities\" over the disaster. Shailyn Peña has heard about the fire at the nightclub and is among those who thinks it played a part. However, for now she has bigger worries. Despite the family's efforts to protect them, her younger stepsisters found out that their father and mother were trapped under the rubble from other children at school. They are \"terrified\", she added. It is Shailyn's birthday on Thursday, a day she would normally celebrate alongside her father, stepmother and aunt. Instead, she must endure it in the worst possible circumstances, caught inside the worst such tragedy in her country's modern history."

        "title": "Despair as death toll from Dominican Republic nightclub collapse rises",
        "date": "2025-04-09T18:01:51.307Z",
        "content": "Hundreds of rescue workers in the Dominican Republic continue to search for survivors of a roof collapse at a nightclub in the capital, Santo Domingo. At least 124 people died and more than 150 were injured in the incident, which happened just before 01:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Tuesday at the Jet Set club, officials said. Head of Emergency Operations Juan Manuel Méndez estimated that his team had \"24 to 36 hours left\" to try to find survivors under the rubble. Hundreds of guests were inside the popular venue attending a concert by merengue singer Rubby Pérez.  Pérez, as well as former Major League Baseball players Octavio Dotel and Tony Blanco, and a provincial governor are among those who have been confirmed dead. Mobile phone footage recorded inside the club, which has been verified by the BBC, shows Pérez on stage singing while the man recording can be heard talking. \"Something fell from the ceiling\" the man recording says, while his finger can be seen pointing towards the roof. In the footage, Pérez can be seen looking towards the area pointed out by the man. Less than 30 seconds later, a noise can be heard and the recording goes black while a woman is heard shouting \"Dad, what's happened to you?\". It is not clear how many people exactly were inside the popular venue but estimates range between 500 and 1,000 people. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed on X that at least one US national, and multiple legal permanent residents, were killed in the roof collapse. He said that he and his wife, Jeanette, were \"united in prayer\" and that the US stands \"ready to support our Dominican allies amid this difficult time\". Emergency workers have demolished one of the walls of the club to better reach those still buried under the rubble. Relatives desperate for news of their missing loved ones have been holding vigils at the scene. Among them was Pérez's daughter Zulinka, who is a backing singer in his merengue band. She described how she had been on stage, singing with her father when the tragedy unfolded. Zulinka said she was saved by her husband, who shielded her with his body when the roof collapsed, telling her that she had to make it out \"to be there for our son\". She managed to crawl out from under the rubble and her husband also made it out alive. Her 69-year-old father, however, remained trapped for hours. According to Zulinka, he survived the collapse and managed to guide emergency workers to his location. \"They found him singing, he started to sing so they would hear him,\" she told local media. But around 17:00 local time, more than 16 hours after the tragedy had occurred, Zulinka was informed by rescue workers at the scene that her father had died before they could free him. His manager later confirmed his death. Nelsy Cruz also survived the initial impact from the falling debris and was among the first to raise the alarm - by directly calling the president of the Dominican Republic. The first call the 41-year-old governor of Monte Cristi province placed as she lay injured in the debris was to President Luis Abinader, asking him to send the emergency services to save those around her who were also severely injured. It was only after she had made the call to the president that Nelsy Cruz called her brother, seven-time Major League Baseball All-Star Nelson Cruz, their father said. She later died in hospital from injuries she had sustained from falling glass. Octavio Dotel, a former Major League Baseball pitcher, is also among those who died after being pulled from the debris. The 51-year-old was rescued alive but died on the way to hospital. It is not yet clear what caused Jet Set's roof to collapse. The club was previously a cinema and had been turned into a music venue hosting  regular dance music concerts on Monday nights. The concerts drew people of all ages and on the day of the collapse, a number of athletes, celebrities and politicians were in attendance. President Abinader has declared three days of national mourning."

        "title": "Tracking the world's major cocaine route to Europe - and why it's growing",
        "date": "2025-04-09T04:59:46.732Z",
        "content": "\"The Albanian mafia would call me and say: 'We want to send 500kg of drugs.' If you don't accept, they kill you.\" César (not his real name) is a member of the Latin Kings, a criminal drug gang in Ecuador. He was recruited by a corrupt counternarcotics police officer to work for the Albanian mafia, one of Europe's most prolific cocaine trafficking networks. The Albanian mafia has expanded its presence in Ecuador in recent years, drawn by key trafficking routes through the country, and it now controls much of the cocaine flow from South America to Europe. Despite Ecuador not producing the drug, 70% of the world's cocaine now flows through its ports, Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa says. It is smuggled into the country from neighbouring Colombia and Peru – the world's two largest producers of cocaine. Police say they seized a record amount of illicit drugs last year, the majority of it cocaine, and that this indicates total exports are on the rise. The consequences are deadly: January 2025 saw 781 murders, making it the deadliest month in recent years. Many of them were related to the illegal drug trade. We spoke to people in the supply chain to understand why this crisis is worsening – and how rising European cocaine consumption is fuelling it. César, 36, first started working with cartels when he was 14 years old, citing poor job opportunities as one factor. \"The Albanians needed someone to solve problems,\" he explains. \"I knew the port guards, the transport drivers, the CCTV camera supervisors.\" He bribes them to help smuggle drugs into Ecuador's ports or to turn a blind eye – and the occasional camera. After cocaine arrives in Ecuador from Colombia or Peru it is stashed in warehouses until his Albanian employers become aware of a shipping container that will be leaving one of the ports for Europe. Gangs use three main methods to smuggle cocaine into shipments: hiding drugs in cargo before it reaches the port, breaking into containers at the port, or attaching drugs to ships at sea. Sometimes César has made up to $3,000 (£2,235) for one job, but the incentive is not just money: \"If you don't do a job the Albanians ask for, they'll kill you.\" César says he feels some regret over his role in the drugs trade, particularly what he calls the \"collateral victims\". But he believes that the fault lies with the consumer countries. \"If consumption keeps growing, so will trafficking. It will be unstoppable,\" he says, adding: \"If they fight it there, it will end here.\" Ordinary workers, not just gang members, get caught in this supply chain. Juan, not his real name, is a truck driver. One day he picked up a tuna shipment to take to the port. He says that something seemed off. \"The first alarm bell was when we went to the warehouse and it only had the cargo, nothing else. It was a rented warehouse, no company name,\" he recalls. \"Two months later, I saw on the news that the containers had been seized in Amsterdam, full of drugs. We never knew.\" Some drivers unknowingly transport drugs; others are coerced – if they refuse, they are killed. European gangs are drawn to Ecuador for its location but also its legal exports, which provide a convenient way to hide illicit cargo. \"Banana exports make up 66% of containers that leave Ecuador, 29.81% go to the European Union, where drug consumption is growing,\" explains banana industry representative José Antonio Hidalgo. Some gangs have even set up fake fruit import or export companies in Europe and Ecuador as a front for illicit activities. \"These European traffickers pose as businessmen,\" says \"José\" (not his real name), a prosecutor who targets organised crime groups and who spoke anonymously due to threats he has received. One notorious example is Dritan Gjika, accused of being one of the most powerful Albanian mafia leaders in Ecuador. Prosecutors say he had stakes in fruit export companies in Ecuador, and import companies in Europe, which he used to traffic cocaine. He remains on the run, but many of his accomplices faced convictions after a multinational police operation. Lawyer Monica Luzárraga defended one of his associates and now speaks candidly about her knowledge of how these networks operate. \"In those years, banana exports to Albania boomed,\" she says. She appears frustrated that authorities did not put two and two together sooner that criminal groups were using this as a front: \"The entire economy here is stagnant. Yet one item that has increased in exports is bananas. So, two plus two equals four.\" At Ecuador's ports, the police and armed forces try to control the situation. Boats patrol the waters, police scan banana boxes for bricks of cocaine – even police scuba divers search for drugs hidden beneath ships. Everyone is heavily armed, even those simply guarding banana boxes before they are loaded into shipping containers. This is because if drugs are found during a search, a corrupt port worker would likely be involved, and it could trigger a violent incident. Despite these efforts, police say the amount of cocaine being successfully smuggled out of Ecuador has reached a record high. Rising demand and economic factors are blamed. Nearly 300 tonnes of drugs were seized last year – a new annual record, according to Ecuador's interior ministry. Major Christian Cozar Cueva of the National Police says that \"there has been about a 30% increase in seizures headed for Europe in recent years\". This increase in cocaine shipments has made it more dangerous for those caught up in the supply chain. Truck driver \"Juan\" says the rise of \"container contamination\" makes him more vulnerable. He says officials seized a container the day before with two tonnes of drugs: \"It used to be kilos, now we talk about tonnes.\" \"If you don't contaminate the containers, you have two options: leave the job or end up dead.\" An economy battered by the Covid pandemic left more Ecuadoreans vulnerable to gang recruitment. A state that was financially stretched post-pandemic, a security force which had less experience dealing with organised crime, and previously lax visa rules facilitated European gangs' presence there post-2020. Monica Luzárraga says 2021 was the year when the \"Albanian mafia infiltration took off\". She says this period coincided with an \"influx\" of Albanian citizens and a spike in banana exports, including to Albania. \"This is a lucrative business that harms Ecuador and benefits criminal organisations. How can we accept an economy built on suffering?\" This ire toward foreign cartels is unsurprising, given their contribution to rising violence. But one thing some traffickers and those fighting them agree on: the trade is fuelled by consumers, particularly in Europe, the US and Australia. UN data showsglobal cocaine consumption has hit record levels. Its surveys suggest the UK has the world's second highest rate of cocaine use. The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) estimates the UK consumes about 117 tonnes of cocaine annually and has the biggest market in Europe. Evidence suggests consumption in the UK is rising. The UK Home Office's analysis of wastewater suggests cocaine consumption increased by 7% from 2023 to 2024. NCA operations seized about 232 tonnes of cocaine in 2024, compared with 194 tonnes in 2023. The NCA's deputy director of threat leadership, Charles Yates, says this makes the UK the \"country of choice\" for organised crime groups who profit from the high demand. He estimates the UK cocaine market is worth around £11bn ($14.2bn), and criminal gangs make about £4bn a year in the UK alone. Those fighting these gangs in Ecuador, like prosecutor José, say it is down to \"countries whose nationals are consumers to exercise greater control\" on those financing the trade. Its victims take many forms. For Mr Hidalgo it is the banana exporters suffering reputational and economic damage. For Ms Luzárraga, it is \"children, adolescents who are being co-opted by criminal gangs\". \"In Europe there are citizens willing to pay large amounts of money to have the drugs they consume. The drugs that are ultimately costing the lives of Ecuadorean citizens.\" The NCA stresses that as well as these \"catastrophic\" effects on communities along the supply chain, cocaine use is claiming additional casualties in users due to cardiovascular and psychological impacts. Cocaine-related deaths in the UK increased by 30% in 2023 compared to 2022, to 1,118. The NCA also warns that the drug exacerbates domestic violence. He is clear law enforcement's efforts to tackle the supply aren't enough: \"Supply side action on its own is never going to be the answer. What's really important is changing the demand.\" From drug gang members to the country's president, this is Ecuador's message to Europe, too. President Daniel Noboa,who is standing for a second termin the presidential election run-off on 13 April, has made fighting criminal gangs one of his main priorities and deployed the military to tackle gang-related violence. He told the BBC: \"The chain that ends in 'UK fun' involves a lot of violence.\" \"What's fun for one person probably involves 20 homicides along the way.\" Additional reporting by Jessica Cruz"

        "content": "At least 113 people have been killed and more than 150 injured after a roof collapsed at a nightclub in the Dominican Republic's capital Santo Domingo, officials have said. A provincial governor and former Major League Baseball pitcher Octavio Dotel were among the victims. Dotel, 51, died on the way to hospital after being pulled from the debris. The incident happened in the early hours of Tuesday at a concert by popular merengue singer Rubby Pérez at the Jet Set nightclub. He was among those killed in the incident, his manager said. Hundreds of people were inside the venue and some 400 rescuers are still searching for survivors. There are fears the death toll will rise further. The director of the Emergency Operations Centre (COE), Juan Manuel Méndez, said he was hopeful that many of those buried under the collapsed roof were still alive. Jet Set is a popular nightclub in Santo Domingo which regularly hosts dance music concerts on Monday evenings. Politicians, athletes and other prominent figures were in attendance. Also among the victims was Nelsy Cruz, governor of Monte Cristi province, President Luis Abinader said. She was the sister of former baseball player Nelson Cruz, a seven-time Major League Baseball All-Star. Dotel meanwhile began playing for the New York Mets in 1999 and played for teams including the Houston Astros, Oakland A's, New York Yankees, Chicago White Sox and Detroit Tigers until 2013. Video footage apparently taken inside the club shows people sitting at tables in front of the stage and some dancing to the music in the back while Rubby Pérez sings. In a separate mobile phone recording shared on social media, a man standing next to the stage can be heard saying \"something fell from the ceiling\", while his finger can be seen pointing towards the roof. In the footage, singer Rubby Pérez, also seems to be looking towards the area pointed out by the man. Less than 30 seconds later, a noise can be heard and the recording goes black while a woman is heard shouting \"Dad, what's happened to you?\". One of Rubby Pérez's band members told local media that the club had been full when the collapse happened \"at around 1am\". \"I thought it was an earthquake,\" the musician said. The daughter of Rubby Pérez said her father was among those trapped in the debris. President Abinader has expressed his condolences to the families affected.

        "content": "Tributes have been paid to a London-based scientist who formerly worked for the Royal Society of Biology (RSB) after he was found murdered in northern Colombia. Alessandro Coatti's remains were discovered on the outskirts of Santa Marta, a port city on the Caribbean coast, on Sunday, investigators say. Santa Marta's Mayor, Carlos Pinedo Cuello, said a reward of 50,000,000 Colombian pesos (£8,940) was being offered for information leading to the capture of those responsible for the death of the Italian citizen. In a statement issued on Tuesday, the RSB said it was \"devastated\" by news of Mr Coatti's killing. \"He was a passionate and dedicated scientist, leading RSB animal science work, writing numerous submissions, organising events and giving evidence in the House of Commons,\" the RSB said. \"Ale was funny, warm, intelligent, loved by everyone he worked with and will be deeply missed by all who knew and worked with him. \"Our thoughts and best wishes go out to his friends and family at this truly awful time.\" Santa Marta is a gateway to some of Colombia's most popular tourist destinations including Tayrona National Park, Minca and the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains. Mr Coatti, who took a master's course at University College London (UCL), worked for the RSB for eight years as science policy officer before being promoted to senior science policy officer. He left the RSB at the end of 2024 to volunteer in Ecuador and travel in South America. Parts of the scientist's dismembered body were found in a suitcase dumped in a stream. Posting on X, Mr Pinedo Cuello said: \"This crime will not go unpunished. The criminals must know that crime has no place in Santa Marta. We will pursue them until they are brought to justice.\" A hotel worker who spoke to Colombian newspaper El Tiempo said Mr Coatti had inquired about visiting the village of Minca and was conducting research on local animal species."

In his new BBC series, the ex-professional footballer speaks to young men involved in criminality, from favelas in Brazil to gangs in Sweden. And he also explores other topics like rhino poaching in South Africa and illegal gold mining in Colombia. He wanted to understand why they had chosen a life of crime, its \"heartbreaking\" impact on people and how some were finding a way out. Cain recalls meeting one mother in afavela in Rio de Janeiro, whose two children had been murdered. \"It hit me deeply,\" he says. \"To find out how she picked her son up in nothing but a bag of bones from one of the cartels was devastating.\" The presenter, who has faced theloss of his own child, says he hoped \"in that moment, just to make this lady feel comforted, feel heard and feel like she had a voice to speak about all that's wrong in that area\". Favelas are informal settlements and there are more than 1,000 in Rio de Janeiro. Cain shares his shock walking into one favela and seeing people openly selling drugs or walking around with guns \"like it was normal\". \"Criminality is around these guys,\" he says, explaining that they get picked up off the street and promised they're going to be looked after. \"In the end, they always end up in the same place, unfortunately.\" He adds that many of the people he met were not happy. \"They don't enjoy doing what they're doing, they're scared, they're worried, they're in pain,\" he says. Cain travelled to different favelas, including to one where documentary crews had never been allowed to film. He spoke to masked men selling drugs out in the open and carrying large weapons - they explained that teenagers as young as 13 had sometimes become involved in criminal activity in the favela. When asked by Cain why they don't choose other ways to make money, one man talked about the lack of jobs in the area. However, Cain says it was \"really shocking\" to speak to an armed young man working for a cartel who was from a \"relatively middle-class\" background. \"I'm thinking, you're risking your life every single day because of what you believe to be perceived as a good thing, as a cool thing,\" he says. Cain notes that for many in favelas it is a \"reality to see and hear bullets flying every single day\". Cain also spoke to young men looking for other options. He remembers meeting one man running a music enterprise, trying to get young men out of gangs by providing them opportunities to DJ and \"teaching them skills to allow them to live a much more prosperous and safer life\". Cain also met a young man at a cocktail-making class from a favela who had previously been shot - but was now choosing to learn new skills. \"That shows with the right support, with initiatives and with people that are trying to make a difference in these communities, you can save lives,\" he says. The main thing Cain says he took away from speaking to these young men was to be there to listen to his sons and to \"lead by example [to] be the kind of man that I would enjoy to see my sons being\". Cain says he hopes the series encourages people to talk to their children. \"Somebody might be sitting next to their young son, who's the same age as some of these guys here wielding weapons, and just think, 'maybe I need to pay more attention, maybe I need to pay more time, maybe I need to listen more.'\""
